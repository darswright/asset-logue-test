This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Hi James and Jon, this is what I've managed to knock up overnight. I would have liked to have spent more time on it to refactor the CSS, but we had some family over on Wednesday night so was only able to spend Thursday night on it. I would usually have broken the codebase down into it's reusable parts and setup variables and mixins for that to keep things DRY and easily maintainable. I also would have spend more time on architecting the file structure, file names etc. but hopefully it illustrates my ability to code CSS to a pretty high level.

I've chucked a live version up on Netlify to make it easy to view, you can check it out [here](https://asset-logue-test.netlify.com/).

Look forward to hearing back from you guys üëç
